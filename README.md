Model Evaluation & Validation

- Understanding how to measure model quality is critical:

- Cross-validation: K-fold, time-series split

- Hyperparameter tuning: Grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization

- Metrics for imbalanced datasets: F1, precision-recall curves, balanced accuracy

- Model interpretability: SHAP, LIME, partial dependence

- This also connects to your AutoML knowledge because AutoML optimizes metrics automatically.
